# Learning Without Critics? Revisiting GRPO in Classical Reinforcement Learning Environments

This is the code for the paper "Learning Without Critics? Revisiting GRPO in Classical Reinforcement Learning Environments".
All the experiments are defined in the `experiment.sh` script. To reproduce the experiments, you can use the following methods:

## Without Docker

1. Install UV.
2. Install dependencies with `uv sync` and then `uv sync --extra mujoco`
3. Test with CartPole: `uv run python algorithm.py --no-track`
4. Run all missing experiments using all CPU cores: `bash launch_all_cpus.sh`
6. Alternatively, manually run the experiments with `bash experiment.sh <total_instances> <current_instance_index>`, e.g.:

```bash
bash experiment.sh 1 0  # to run all experiments sequentially
```

or 

```bash
# each in a different terminal instance (e.g. tmux):
bash experiment.sh 4 0
bash experiment.sh 4 1  
bash experiment.sh 4 2
bash experiment.sh 4 3
```

The `experiment.sh` script will first enumerate all experiments and then split them into the total number of instances and run the commands that are multiples of the current instance index.

## With Docker

1. `docker build -t grpo .`
2. `docker run -e WANDB_API_KEY=<key> grpo`
